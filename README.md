# landing-page-assignment
This project will be to recreate a business webpage as closely as possible based upon a basic design spec, which will be provided. I can personalise the page as much as I want and I do intend to do so.

So far, I have learned the HTML5 and CSS basics and feel quite comfortable in implementing these to a basic project. I am really looking forward to trying out some new design ideas, especially using flex, now that I have an understanding of it.

I am hoping to be able to get more practice in committing to git in the standard and expected fashion, however I am still not completely confident that I am doing it correctly!

We shall see....
